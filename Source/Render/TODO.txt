1. Slice planes

	a) Design
		i) In SlicePlane Mode, the volume is not rendered. 
		Instead, the user can control a slice plane which is rendered with the information from the volume data.
		
		ii) Controlling the slice plane is performed with:
			Translation: WASD
			Rotation: Left Mouse Button
			
		iii) Button / Hotkey for "Save slice shot" -> bmp file: "slice01.bmp"...

	b) Viewport Manager (like in Autodesk 3DStudio Max)
